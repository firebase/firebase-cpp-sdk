 * @brief A write batch is used to perform multiple writes as a single atomic
 * unit.
 *
 * A WriteBatch object provides methods for adding writes to the write batch.
 * None of the writes will be committed (or visible locally) until Commit() is
 * called.
 *
 * Unlike transactions, write batches are persisted offline and therefore are
 * preferable when you don't need to condition your writes on read data.
 *
 * @note Firestore classes are not meant to be subclassed except for use in test
 * mocks. Subclassing is not supported in production code and new SDK releases
 * may break code that does so.
