 * Simple {@code Executor} implementation wraps around a single threaded executor and swallows
 * {@code RejectedExecutionException} when executing commands.
 *
 * <p>During shutdown, the C++ API must be able to prevent user callbacks from running after the
 * Firestore object has been disposed. To do so, it shuts down its executors, accepting that new
 * callbacks may be rejected, and if there is work already scheduled, they will not be executed.
 *
 * This class catches and discards the {@code RejectedExecutionException}
 * that is thrown by the underlying Java executor after shutdown, bridging the gap between C++
 * expectations and the Java implementation.
