/**
 * Returns a system-defined best directory in which to create application
 * data. Values vary wildly across platforms. They include:
 *
 *   * iOS: $container/Library/Application Support/$app_name
 *   * Linux: $HOME/.local/share/$app_name
 *   * macOS: $container/Library/Application Support/$app_name
 *   * Other UNIX: $HOME/.$app_name. Note: Android is not implemented yet.
 *   * tvOS: $container/Library/Caches/$app_name
 *   * Windows: %USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local
 *
 * On iOS, tvOS, and macOS (when running sandboxed), these locations are
 * relative to the data container for the current application. On macOS when
 * the application is not sandboxed, the returned value will be relative to
 * $HOME instead. See "About the iOS File System" in the Apple "File System
 * Programming Guide" at https://apple.co/2Nn7Bsb.
 *
 * Note: the returned path is just where the system thinks the application
 * data should be stored, but `AppDataDir` does not actually guarantee that this
 * path exists (unless `should_create` is `true`, in which case it will attempt
 * to create a directory at the given path).
 *
 * @param app_name The name of the application.
 * @return The path to the application data, or an empty string if an error
 *     occurred.
