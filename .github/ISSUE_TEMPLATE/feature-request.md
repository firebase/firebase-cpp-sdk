### [READ] Guidelines

A good feature request ideally
* is either immediately obvious (i.e. "Add Sign in with Apple support"), or
* starts with a use case that is not achievable with the existing Firebase API and
  includes an API proposal that would make the use case possible. The proposed API
  change does not need to be very specific.

Once you've read this section, please delete it and fill out the rest of the template.

### Feature proposal

* Firebase Component: _____ (Auth, Core, Database, Firestore, Messaging, Storage, etc)

Describe your use case and/or feature request here.
