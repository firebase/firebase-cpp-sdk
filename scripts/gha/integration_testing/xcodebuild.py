"""Helper module for working with xcode projects.

The tool xcodebuild provides support to build xcode projects from the command
line. The motivation was to simplify usage of xcodebuild, since it was non-trivial 
to figure out which flags were needed to get it working in a CI environment.
The options required by the methods in this module were found to work both
locally and on CI, with both the Unity and C++ projects.

get_args_for_build() method doesn't performing operations with xcodebuild directly, 
this module returns arg sequences. These sequences can be passed to e.g. 
subprocess.run to execute the operations.

get_args_for_build() support either device or simulator builds. For simulator
builds, it suffices to use get_args_for_build() to create a .app that can be
used with simulators. For unsigned device builds, generate .app via 
get_args_for_build() step and then use generate_unsigned_ipa() to package 
the .app to .ipa.
