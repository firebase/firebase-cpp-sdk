# Firebase C++ SDK

The Firebase C++ SDK provides C++ interfaces for the following Firebase services
on *iOS* and *Android*:

*   AdMob
*   Firebase Analytics
*   Firebase Authentication
*   Firebase Cloud Messaging
*   Firebase Dynamic Links
*   Cloud Firestore
*   Firebase Functions
*   Firebase Installations
*   Firebase Instance ID (deprecated SDK)
*   Firebase Realtime Database
*   Firebase Remote Config
*   Firebase Storage

## Desktop Workflow Implementations

The Firebase C++ SDK includes desktop workflow support for the following subset
of Firebase features, enabling their use on Windows, OS X, and Linux:

*   Firebase Authentication
*   Cloud Firestore
*   Firebase Functions
*   Firebase Remote Config
*   Firebase Realtime Database
*   Firebase Storage

This is a Beta feature, and is intended for workflow use only during the
development of your app, not for publicly shipping code.

## Stub Implementations

Stub (non-functional) implementations of the remaining libraries are provided
for convenience when building for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux so that you don't
need to conditionally compile code when also targeting the desktop.

## Directory Structure

The following table provides an overview of the Firebase C++ SDK directory
structure.

listed above.

### Desktop Implementation Dependencies

#### Linux libraries

For Linux, library versions are provided for 32-bit (i386) and 64-bit (x86_64)
platforms.

Two sets of Linux libraries are available: one set built against the newer C++11
ABI, and another set built against the standard (legacy) ABI. This is equivalent
to the compiler option -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1 or 0, respectively.

The provided libraries have been tested using Visual Studio 2019. When
building C++ desktop apps on Windows, you will need to link the following
Windows SDK libraries (consult your compiler documentation for more
information):

Firebase C++ Library | Windows SDK library dependencies
-------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------
Authentication       | `advapi32, ws2_32, crypt32`
Firestore            | `advapi32, ws2_32, crypt32, rpcrt4, ole32, shell32`

Remote Config        | `advapi32, ws2_32, crypt32, rpcrt4, ole32`
Storage              | `advapi32, ws2_32, crypt32`

## Getting Started

See our [setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cpp/setup) to get started
and download the prebuilt version of the Firebase C++ SDK.

## Source Code

The Firebase C++ SDK is open source. You can find the source code (and
information about building it) at
[github.com/firebase/firebase-cpp-sdk](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-cpp-sdk).

## Platform Notes

### iOS Method Swizzling

On iOS, some application events (such as opening URLs and receiving
notifications) require your application delegate to implement specific methods.
For example, receiving a notification may require your application delegate to
implement `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:`. Because each iOS
application has its own app delegate, Firebase uses _method swizzling_, which
allows the replacement of one method with another, to attach its own handlers in
addition to any you may have implemented.

The Firebase Cloud Messaging library needs to attach
handlers to the application delegate using method swizzling. If you are using
these libraries, at load time, Firebase will identify your `AppDelegate` class
and swizzle the required methods onto it, chaining a call back to your existing
method implementation.

### Custom Android Build Systems

We currently provide generate\_xml\_from\_google\_services\_json.py to convert
google-services.json to .xml resources to be included in an Android application.
This script applies the same transformation that the Google Play Services Gradle
plug-in performs when building Android applications. Users who don't use Gradle
(e.g ndk-build, makefiles, Visual Studio etc.) can use this script to automate
the generation of string resources.

### ProGuard on Android

Many Android build systems use
[ProGuard](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html) for
builds in Release mode to shrink application sizes and protect Java source code.
If you use ProGuard, you will need to add the files in libs/android/*.pro
corresponding to the Firebase C++ libraries you are using to your ProGuard
configuration.

For example, with Gradle, build.gradle would contain:
~~~
  android {
    [...other stuff...]
    buildTypes {
      release {
        minifyEnabled true
        proguardFile getDefaultProguardFile('your-project-proguard-config.txt')
        proguardFile file(project.ext.firebase_cpp_sdk_dir + "/libs/android/app.pro")
        proguardFile file(project.ext.firebase_cpp_sdk_dir + "/libs/android/analytics.pro")
        [...and so on, for each Firebase C++ library you are using.]
      }
    }
  }
~~~

### Requiring Google Play services on Android

Many Firebase C++ libraries require
[Google Play services](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview) on
the user's Android device. If a Firebase C++ library returns
[`kInitResultFailedMissingDependency`](http://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/namespace/firebase)
on initialization, it means Google Play services is not available on the device
(it needs to be updated, reactivated, permissions fixed, etc.) and that Firebase
library cannot be used until the situation is corrected.

You can find out why Google Play services is unavailable (and try to fix it) by
using the functions in
[`google_play_services/availability.h`](http://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/namespace/google-play-services).

Optionally, you can use
[`ModuleInitializer`](http://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/class/firebase/module-initializer)
to initialize one or more Firebase libraries, which will handle prompting the
user to update Google Play services if required.

Note: Some libraries do not require Google Play services and don't return any
initialization status. These can be used without Google Play services. The table
below summarizes whether Google Play services is required by each Firebase C++
library.

Firebase C++ Library | Google Play services required?
-------------------- | ---------------------------------
Analytics            | Not required
AdMob                | Not required (usually; see below)
Cloud Messaging      | Required
Auth                 | Required
Dynamic Links        | Required
Firestore            | Required
Functions            | Required
Installations        | Not Required
Instance ID          | Required
Realtime Database    | Required
Remote Config        | Required
Storage              | Required

#### A note on AdMob and Google Play services

Most versions of the Google Mobile Ads SDK for Android can work properly without
Google Play services. However, if you are using the
`com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-lite` dependency instead of the
standard `com.google.firebase:firebase-ads` dependency, Google Play services
WILL be required in your specific case.

AdMob initialization will only return `kInitResultFailedMissingDependency` when
Google Play services is unavailable AND you are using
`com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-lite`.

### Desktop project setup

To use desktop workflow support, you must have an Android or iOS project set up
in the Firebase console.

If you have an Android project, you can simply use the `google-services.json`
file on desktop.

If you have an iOS project and don't wish to create an Android project, you can
use the included Python script `generate_xml_from_google_services_json.py
--plist` to convert your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file into a
`google-services-desktop.json` file.

By default, when your app initializes, Firebase will look for a file named
`google-services.json` or `google-services-desktop.json` in the current
directory. Ensure that one of these files is present, or call
`AppOptions::LoadFromJsonConfig()` before initializing Firebase to specify your
JSON configuration data directly.

### Note on Firebase C++ desktop support

Firebase C++ SDK desktop support is a **Beta** feature, and is intended for
workflow use only during the development of your app, not for publicly shipping
code.

## Release Notes

### 7.3.0
-   Changes
    -   General (Android): the STLPort support is deprecated and will be removed
        in the next major release. Please [use libc++ instead](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpp-support#cs).

        Studio 2019. While VS 2019 is binary-compatible with VS 2015 and
        VS 2017, you must use VS 2019 or newer to link the desktop SDK.
        The libraries have been moved from libs/windows/VS2015 to
        libs/windows/VS2019 to reflect this.
    -   General (Desktop): Linux libraries are now built with both the
        C++11 ABI and the legacy ABI. The libraries have been moved
        from libs/linux/${arch} to libs/linux/${arch}/legacy and
        libs/linux/${arch}/cxx11 to reflect this.
    -   AdMob (Android): Fix a JNI error when initializing without Firebase App.
    -   Analytics: Remove deprecated SetMinimumSessionDuration call.

        `const`.
    -   Firestore: Added new internal HTTP headers to the gRPC connection.
    -   Firestore: Fixed a crash when writing to a document after having been
        offline for long enough that the auth token expired
        ([#182](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-cpp-sdk/issues/182)).

### 6.16.1
-   Changes
    -   Database (Desktop): Added a function to create directories recursively
        for persistent storage that fixes segfaults.
    -   Database (Desktop): Fixed a problem with missing symbols on Windows.

### 6.16.0
-   Changes
    -   Database (Desktop): Enabled offline persistence.
    -   Auth: Fixed compiler error related to SignInResult.
    -   Firestore: Defaulted to calling listeners and other callbacks on a
        dedicated thread. This avoids deadlock when using Firestore without
        an event loop on desktop platforms.
    -   Firestore: Added `Error::kErrorNone` as a synonym for `Error::kErrorOk`,
        which is more consistent with other Firebase C++ SDKs.
    -   Messaging (Android): Updated library to be compatible with Android O,
        which should resolve a IllegalStateException that could occur under
        certain conditions.
    -   Messaging: Deprecated the `Send` function.
    -   Firestore: Added `error_message` parameter to snapshot listener
        callbacks.
    -   AdMob: Handling IllegalStateException when creating and loading

        fallback error.

### 6.15.1

-   Changes

    -   Firestore: all members of `Error` enumeration are now prefixed with
        `kError`; for example, `Error::kUnavailable` is now
        `Error::kErrorUnavailable`, which is more consistent with other Firebase
        C++ SDKs.
    -   Firestore: Firestore can now be compiled on Windows even in presence of
        `min` and `max` macros defined in `<windows.h>`.
    -   Fixed an issue that warns about Future handle not released properly.

### 6.15.0

-   Overview
    -   Fixed an issue whent creating Apps, and various Firestore changes.
-   Changes
    -   Firestore: removed `*LastResult` functions from the public API. Please
        use the futures returned by the async methods directly instead.
    -   Firestore: dropped the `From` prefix from the static functions in
        `FieldValue`; for example, `FieldValue::FromInteger` is now just
        `FieldValue::Integer`.
    -   Firestore: `CollectionReference::id` now returns a const reference.
    -   Firestore: Fixed absl `time_internal` linker error on Windows.
    -   Firestore: changed the signature of the callback passed to
        `Firestore::RunTransaction` to pass the parameters by mutable reference,
        not by pointer. This is to indicate that these parameters are never
        null.
    -   App: Fixed an assert creating a custom App when there is no default App.

### 6.14.1

-   Changes
    -   Auth (iOS): Added SignInResult.UserInfo.updated_credential field. On
        iOS, kAuthErrorCredentialAlreadyInUse errors when linking with Apple may
        contain a valid updated_credential for use in signing-in the
        Apple-linked user.

### 6.14.0

-   Changes
    -   Firestore: `Firestore::set_logging_enabled` is replaced by
        `Firestore::set_log_level` for consistency with other Firebase C++ APIs.
    -   Firestore: added an overload of `Firestore::CollectionGroup` that takes
        a pointer to `const char`.
    -   Firestore: `Firestore::set_settings` now accepts the argument by value.

### 6.12.0
  - Overview
    - Added experimental support for Cloud Firestore SDK.

        after the auth token is revoked.

### 6.10.0

-   Overview
    -   Auth bug fixes.
-   Changes
    -   Auth: Reverted the API of an experimental FederatedAuthHandler callback
        handler.
    -   Auth (iOS): Enabled the method OAuthProvider.GetCredential. This method
        takes a nonce parameter as required by Apple Sign-in.
    -   General (iOS): Updated the CMakeLists.txt to link static libraries
        stored under libs/ios/universal for iOS targets

### 6.9.0

-   Overview
    -   Updated dependencies, added support for Apple Sign-in to Auth, support
        for signing-in using a 3rd party web providers and configuration of
        BigQuery export in Messaging.
-   Changes
    -   Auth: Added API for invoking Auth SignInWithProvider and User
        LinkWithProvider and ReauthenticateWithProvider for sign in with third
        party auth providers.
    -   Auth: Added constant kProviderId strings to auth provider classes.
    -   Auth (iOS): Added support for linking Apple Sign-in credentials.

        delivery metrics export to BigQuery. This functionality is currently
        only available on Android. Stubs are provided on iOS for cross platform
        compatibility.

### 6.8.0

-   Overview
    -   Updated dependencies, added compiler/stdlib check, fixed issue in Admob
        and fixed resource generation issue with python3.
-   Changes

        executable and firebase library are compiled with the same compiler and
        stdlib.
    -   Admob (Android): Fixed a potentially non thread safe operation in the
        destruction of BannerViews.
    -   General: Fixed an issue where resource generation from
        google-services.json would fail if python3 was used to execute the
        resource generation script.

### 6.7.0

-   Overview
    -   Updated dependencies, fixed issues in Analytics, Database, Storage, and

    -   Auth: Fixed a crash caused by a stale memory reference when a
        firebase::auth::Auth object is destroyed and then recreated for the same
        App object.
    -   Auth: Fixed potential memory corruption when AuthStateListener is
        destroyed. ### 3.1.1

        is then opened by via the app icon rather than the notification.
    -   Invites (iOS): Fixed an issue which resulted in the app delegate method
        application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation: not being called when
        linking the invites library.
    -   Storage: Fixed a bug that prevented the construction of Metadata without
        a storage reference.

    -   Added support for multiple storage buckets in Cloud Storage for
        Firebase, and fixed a bug in Invites.
-   Changes
    -   Storage: Renamed "Firebase Storage" to "Cloud Storage for Firebase".
    -   Storage: Added an overload for `Storage::GetInstance()` that accepts a
        `gs://...` URL, so you can use Cloud Storage with multiple buckets.
    -   Invites: (Android) Fixed an issue where invites with empty links would
        fail to be received.

### 3.0.0

-   Overview
    -   Renamed some methods, fixed some bugs, and added some features.
-   Changes
    -   General: Renamed and deprecated methods that were inconsistent with the

        `GetCredential()` is valid.
    -   Invites: (Android) Added a `Fetch()` function to fetch incoming
        invitations at times other than application start. You must call this on
        Android when your app returns to the foreground (on iOS, this is handled
        automatically).
    -   Messaging: Added a field to `firebase::messaging::Message` specifying
        whether the message was received when the app was in the background.
    -   Messaging: (Android) Added an AAR file containing the Android manifest
        changes needed for receiving notifications. You can add this to your
        project instead of modifying the manifest directly.

        that caused a crash after displaying multiple interstitial ads.

### 2.1.1

-   Overview
    -   Bug fixes for Firebase Authentication, Messaging and Invites.
-   Changes
    -   Auth: (Android) Fixed an issue that caused a future to never complete
        when signing in while a user is already signed in.
    -   Messaging / Invites: (iOS) Fixed an issue with method swizzling that
        caused some of the application's UIApplicationDelegate methods to not be
        called.

    -   Support for AdMob Native Express Ads, Realtime Database and simplified
        the Invites API.
-   Changes
    -   AdMob: Added support for AdMob Native Express Ads.
    -   Auth: Added AuthStateListener class which provides notifications when a
        user is logged in or logged out.
    -   Realtime Database: Added a client library.

### 1.2.0

-   Overview
    -   New features in AdMob, Authentication, Messaging, and Remote Config, a
        helper class for initialization, and bug fixes.
-   Changes
    -   General: Added firebase::ModuleInitializer, a helper class to initialize
        Firebase modules and handle any missing dependency on Google Play
        services on Android.
    -   AdMob: Added Rewarded Video feature. For more information, see the
        [Rewarded Video C++ guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admob/cpp/rewarded-video).
    -   AdMob: You can now pass your AdMob App ID to
        firebase::admob::Initialize() to help reduce latency for the initial ad
        request.
    -   AdMob: On both iOS and Android, you must call BannerView::Show() to
        display the ad. Previously, this was only required on Android.
    -   AdMob: Fixed an issue where BannerView::Listener received an incorrect
        bounding box.
    -   AdMob: BannerView now has a black background, rather than transparent.
    -   Authentication: Implemented User::SendEmailVerification() and
        User::EmailVerified() methods on Android.
    -   Invites: Fixed a bug that occurred when initializing InvitesSender and
        InvitesReceiver at the same time.

    -   Messaging: Fixed a crash that occurred on Android if Messaging was
        initialized before the native library was loaded.
    -   RemoteConfig: Added GetKeys() and GetKeysByPrefix() methods, which get a
        list of the app's Remote Config parameter keys.

### 1.1.0

-   Overview
    -   Minor bug fixes and new way of checking Google Play services
        availability.
-   Changes
    -   Reverted the firebase::App changes from version 1.0.1 relating to Google
        Play services; this has been replaced with a new API.
    -   Each Firebase C++ library that requires Google Play services now checks
        for its availability at initialization time. See "Requiring Google Play
        services on Android".
        -   firebase::auth::GetAuth() now has an optional output parameter that
            indicates whether initialization was successful, and will return
            nullptr if not.
        -   firebase::messaging::Initialize() now returns a result that
            indicates whether initialization was successful.
        -   Added firebase::invites::Initialize(), which you must call once
            prior to creating InvitesSender or InvitesReceiver instances. This
            function returns a result that indicates whether initialization was
            successful.
        -   firebase::remote_config::Initialize() now returns a result that
            indicates whether initialization was successful.
        -   firebase::admob::Initialize() now returns a result that indicates
            whether initialization was successful.
    -   Added utility functions to check whether Google Play services is
        available. See google_play_services::CheckAvailability() and
        google_play_services::MakeAvailable() for more information.
-   Known Issues
    -   Invites: If you call InvitesReceiver::Fetch() or
        InvitesReceiver::ConvertInvitation() without first calling
        firebase::invites::Initialize(), the operation will never complete. To
        work around the issue, ensure that firebase::invites::Initialize() is
        called once before creating any InvitesReceiver instances.

### 1.0.1

-   Overview
    -   Minor bug fixes.
-   Changes
    -   Modified firebase::App to check for the required version of Google Play
        services on creation to prevent firebase::App creation failing if a
        user's device is out of date. If Google Play services is out of date, a
        dialog will prompt the user to install a new version. See "Requiring
        Google Play services on Android". With the previous version (version
        1.0.0) the developer needed to manually check for an up to date Google
        Play services using GoogleApiClient.
    -   Fixed potential deadlock when using SetListener from a notification
        callback in firebase::admob::InterstitialAd and
        firebase::admob::BannerView on iOS.
    -   Fixed race condition on destruction of admob::BannerView on Android.
    -   Fixed Future handle leak. An internal memory leak would manifest for
        objects or modules that use futures for the lifetime of the object or
        module. For example, during the lifetime of BannerView each call to a
        method which returns a Future could potentially allocate memory which
        wouldn't be reclaimed until the BannerView is destroyed.

### 1.0.0

-   Overview
    -   First public release. See our
        [setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cpp/setup) to get
        started.
-   Known Issues
    -   Android armeabi libraries must be linked with gcc 4.8.
