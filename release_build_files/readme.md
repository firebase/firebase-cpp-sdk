# Firebase C++ SDK

The Firebase C++ SDK provides C++ interfaces for the following Firebase services
on *iOS* and *Android*:

*   Firebase Analytics
*   Firebase App Check
*   Firebase Authentication
*   Firebase Cloud Messaging
*   Firebase Dynamic Links
*   Cloud Firestore
*   Firebase Functions
*   Google Mobile Ads
*   Firebase Installations
*   Firebase Instance ID (deprecated SDK)
*   Firebase Realtime Database
*   Firebase Remote Config
*   Firebase Storage

## Desktop Workflow Implementations

The Firebase C++ SDK includes desktop workflow support for the following subset
of Firebase features, enabling their use on Windows, OS X, and Linux:

*   Firebase Authentication
*   Firebase App Check
*   Cloud Firestore
*   Firebase Functions
*   Firebase Remote Config
*   Firebase Realtime Database
*   Firebase Storage

This is a Beta feature, and is intended for workflow use only during the
development of your app, not for publicly shipping code.

## Stub Implementations

Stub (non-functional) implementations of the remaining libraries are provided
for convenience when building for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux so that you don't
need to conditionally compile code when also targeting the desktop.

## Directory Structure

The following table provides an overview of the Firebase C++ SDK directory
structure.

Directories               | Contents
------------------------- | --------
include                   | C++ headers

## C++ Language Standards

The Firebase C++ SDK supports the C++14 language standard. For more information,
please see our [C++ Language Standard Support
Criteria](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support#c_language_standard).

## Library / XCFramework Dependencies

Each feature has dependencies upon libraries in this SDK and components
distributed as part of the core Firebase
[iOS SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) and
[Android SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).

The Firebase C++ SDK uses an Android BoM (Bill of Materials) to specify a single
Firebase Android SDK version number to use, rather than individual versions for
each library. For more information, please see the [Firebase Android SDK
documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/learn-more#bom).

#### Gradle dependency file

Firebase C++ includes an `Android/firebase_dependencies.gradle` file
that helps you include the correct Android dependencies and Proguard
files for each Firebase product. To use it, include the following in
your build.gradle file (you can omit any Firebase products you aren't
using):

```
apply from: "$gradle.firebase_cpp_sdk_dir/Android/firebase_dependencies.gradle"
firebaseCpp.dependencies {
  app  // Recommended for all apps using Firebase.
  analytics
  appCheck
  auth
  database
  dynamicLinks
  firestore
  functions
  gma
  installations
  messaging
  remoteConfig
  storage
}
```

#### Google Play services module

If you wish to use the `google_play_services::CheckAvailability` and
`MakeAvailable` functions, or `firebase::ModuleInitializer`, you must include
com.google.android.gms:play-services-base as a dependency as well, as listed
under "Google Play services module" in the table above. If you use the Gradle
dependency file described above, this dependency will automatically be included.
To omit it (not recommended), specify `appWithoutPlayServices` instead of `app`
in `firebaseCpp.dependencies`.

### iOS Dependencies

iOS users can include either xcframeworks or static libraries depending upon their
preferred build environment.

### Desktop Implementation Dependencies

#### Linux libraries

For Linux, library versions are provided for 32-bit (i386) and 64-bit (x86_64)
platforms.

Two sets of Linux libraries are available: one set built against the newer C++11
ABI, and another set built against the standard (legacy) ABI. This is equivalent
to the compiler option -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1 or 0, respectively.

## Getting Started

See our [setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cpp/setup) to get started
and download the prebuilt version of the Firebase C++ SDK.

## Source Code

The Firebase C++ SDK is open source. You can find the source code (and
information about building it) at
[github.com/firebase/firebase-cpp-sdk](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-cpp-sdk).

## Platform Notes

### iOS Method Swizzling

On iOS, some application events (such as opening URLs and receiving
notifications) require your application delegate to implement specific methods.
For example, receiving a notification may require your application delegate to
implement `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:`. Because each iOS
application has its own app delegate, Firebase uses _method swizzling_, which
allows the replacement of one method with another, to attach its own handlers in
addition to any you may have implemented.

The Firebase Cloud Messaging library needs to attach
handlers to the application delegate using method swizzling. If you are using
these libraries, at load time, Firebase will identify your `AppDelegate` class
and swizzle the required methods onto it, chaining a call back to your existing
method implementation.

### Custom Android Build Systems

We currently provide generate\_xml\_from\_google\_services\_json.py to convert
google-services.json to .xml resources to be included in an Android application.
This script applies the same transformation that the Google Play Services Gradle
plug-in performs when building Android applications. Users who don't use Gradle
(e.g ndk-build, makefiles, Visual Studio etc.) can use this script to automate
the generation of string resources.

### ProGuard on Android

Many Android build systems use
[ProGuard](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html) for
builds in Release mode to shrink application sizes and protect Java source code.
If you use ProGuard, you will need to add the files in libs/android/*.pro
corresponding to the Firebase C++ libraries you are using to your ProGuard
configuration.

For example, with Gradle, build.gradle would contain:
~~~
  android {
    [...other stuff...]
    buildTypes {
      release {
        minifyEnabled true
        proguardFile getDefaultProguardFile('your-project-proguard-config.txt')
        proguardFile file(project.ext.firebase_cpp_sdk_dir + "/libs/android/app.pro")
        proguardFile file(project.ext.firebase_cpp_sdk_dir + "/libs/android/analytics.pro")
        [...and so on, for each Firebase C++ library you are using.]
      }
    }
  }
~~~

### Requiring Google Play services on Android

Many Firebase C++ libraries require
[Google Play services](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview) on
the user's Android device. If a Firebase C++ library returns
[`kInitResultFailedMissingDependency`](http://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/namespace/firebase)
on initialization, it means Google Play services is not available on the device
(it needs to be updated, reactivated, permissions fixed, etc.) and that Firebase
library cannot be used until the situation is corrected.

You can find out why Google Play services is unavailable (and try to fix it) by
using the functions in
[`google_play_services/availability.h`](http://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/namespace/google-play-services).

Optionally, you can use
[`ModuleInitializer`](http://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/class/firebase/module-initializer)
to initialize one or more Firebase libraries, which will handle prompting the
user to update Google Play services if required.

Note: Some libraries do not require Google Play services and don't return any
initialization status. These can be used without Google Play services. The table
below summarizes whether Google Play services is required by each Firebase C++
library.

Firebase C++ Library | Google Play services required?
-------------------- | ---------------------------------
Analytics            | Not required
App Check            | Not required
Cloud Messaging      | Required
Auth                 | Required
Dynamic Links        | Required
Firestore            | Required
Functions            | Required
Installations        | Not Required
Instance ID          | Required
Google Mobile Ads    | Not required (usually; see below)
Realtime Database    | Required
Remote Config        | Required
Storage              | Required

#### A note on Google Mobile Ads and Google Play services

Most versions of the Google Mobile Ads SDK for Android can work properly without
Google Play services. However, if you are using the
`com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-lite` dependency instead of the
standard `com.google.firebase:firebase-ads` dependency, Google Play services
WILL be required in your specific case.

GMA initialization will only return `kInitResultFailedMissingDependency` when
Google Play services is unavailable AND you are using
`com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-lite`.

### Desktop project setup

To use desktop workflow support, you must have an Android or iOS project set up
in the Firebase console.

If you have an Android project, you can simply use the `google-services.json`
file on desktop.

If you have an iOS project and don't wish to create an Android project, you can
use the included Python script `generate_xml_from_google_services_json.py
--plist` to convert your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file into a
`google-services-desktop.json` file.

By default, when your app initializes, Firebase will look for a file named
`google-services.json` or `google-services-desktop.json` in the current
directory. Ensure that one of these files is present, or call
`AppOptions::LoadFromJsonConfig()` before initializing Firebase to specify your
JSON configuration data directly.

### Note on Firebase C++ desktop support

Firebase C++ SDK desktop support is a **Beta** feature, and is intended for
workflow use only during the development of your app, not for publicly shipping
code.

## Release Notes
### 11.0.0
-   Changes
    - General: Update minimum supported C++ standard to C++14.
    - General (Android): Update to Firebase Android BoM version 32.0.0.
    - General (iOS): Update to Firebase Cocoapods version 10.9.0.
    - General (iOS, tvOS, Desktop): iOS, tvOS, and macOS SDKs are now built
      using Xcode 14.1.
    - AdMob: Removed deprecated AdMob SDK. Please use the included Google
      Mobile Ads SDK ("GMA") instead.
    - App Check: Adds support for Firebase App Check on Android, iOS, tvOS,

      to refer to the `_DEPRECATED` methods, or switch to the new methods, which
      have new return types `AuthResult` and `User` (rather than `SignInResult`
      and `User *`). The deprecated methods will be removed in the *next* major
      release of the Firebase C++ SDK. *(Note: do not mix and match using the old
      and new methods or undefined behavior may result.)*
    - Firestore: Added `Query::Count()`, which fetches the number of documents
      in the result set without actually downloading the documents
      ([#1207](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-cpp-sdk/pull/1207)).
    - Remote Config (Android/iOS): Added support for real-time config updates.
      Use the new `AddOnConfigUpdateListener` API to get real-time updates.
      Existing [`Fetch`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/class/firebase/remote-config/remote-config#fetch)
      and [`Activate`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/class/firebase/remote-config/remote-config#activate)
      APIs aren't affected by this change. To learn more, see

### 1.2.0

-   Overview
    -   New features in AdMob, Authentication, Messaging, and Remote Config, a
        helper class for initialization, and bug fixes.
-   Changes
    -   General: Added firebase::ModuleInitializer, a helper class to initialize
        Firebase modules and handle any missing dependency on Google Play
        services on Android.
    -   AdMob: Added Rewarded Video feature. For more information, see the
        [Rewarded Video C++ guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admob/cpp/rewarded-video).
    -   AdMob: You can now pass your AdMob App ID to
        firebase::admob::Initialize() to help reduce latency for the initial ad
        request.
    -   AdMob: On both iOS and Android, you must call BannerView::Show() to
        display the ad. Previously, this was only required on Android.
    -   AdMob: Fixed an issue where BannerView::Listener received an incorrect
        bounding box.
    -   AdMob: BannerView now has a black background, rather than transparent.

        initialized before the native library was loaded.
    -   RemoteConfig: Added GetKeys() and GetKeysByPrefix() methods, which get a
        list of the app's Remote Config parameter keys.

### 1.1.0

-   Overview
    -   Minor bug fixes and new way of checking Google Play services
        availability.
-   Changes
    -   Reverted the firebase::App changes from version 1.0.1 relating to Google
        Play services; this has been replaced with a new API.
    -   Each Firebase C++ library that requires Google Play services now checks
        for its availability at initialization time. See "Requiring Google Play
        services on Android".
        -   firebase::auth::GetAuth() now has an optional output parameter that
            indicates whether initialization was successful, and will return
            nullptr if not.
        -   firebase::messaging::Initialize() now returns a result that
            indicates whether initialization was successful.
        -   Added firebase::invites::Initialize(), which you must call once
            prior to creating InvitesSender or InvitesReceiver instances. This
            function returns a result that indicates whether initialization was
            successful.
        -   firebase::remote_config::Initialize() now returns a result that
            indicates whether initialization was successful.
        -   firebase::admob::Initialize() now returns a result that indicates
            whether initialization was successful.
    -   Added utility functions to check whether Google Play services is
        available. See google_play_services::CheckAvailability() and
        google_play_services::MakeAvailable() for more information.
-   Known Issues
    -   Invites: If you call InvitesReceiver::Fetch() or
        InvitesReceiver::ConvertInvitation() without first calling
        firebase::invites::Initialize(), the operation will never complete. To
        work around the issue, ensure that firebase::invites::Initialize() is
        called once before creating any InvitesReceiver instances.

### 1.0.1

-   Overview
    -   Minor bug fixes.
-   Changes
    -   Modified firebase::App to check for the required version of Google Play
        services on creation to prevent firebase::App creation failing if a
        user's device is out of date. If Google Play services is out of date, a
        dialog will prompt the user to install a new version. See "Requiring
        Google Play services on Android". With the previous version (version
        1.0.0) the developer needed to manually check for an up to date Google
        Play services using GoogleApiClient.
    -   Fixed potential deadlock when using SetListener from a notification
        callback in firebase::admob::InterstitialAd and
        firebase::admob::BannerView on iOS.
    -   Fixed race condition on destruction of admob::BannerView on Android.
    -   Fixed Future handle leak. An internal memory leak would manifest for
        objects or modules that use futures for the lifetime of the object or
        module. For example, during the lifetime of BannerView each call to a
        method which returns a Future could potentially allocate memory which
        wouldn't be reclaimed until the BannerView is destroyed.

### 1.0.0

-   Overview
    -   First public release. See our
        [setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cpp/setup) to get
        started.
-   Known Issues
    -   Android armeabi libraries must be linked with gcc 4.8.
