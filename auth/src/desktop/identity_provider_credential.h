// Most types of credentials are IdP credentials which go through
// VerifyAssertion API. Notable exceptions are email and phone; client code can
// create (Email|Phone)AuthCredential and pass it to SignInWithCredential, which
// is effectively another way of calling SignInWithEmailAndPassword/etc (this is
// how it works in other language SDKs, and desktop should have the same
// behavior for consistency). Now, all credentials that actually go through
// SignInWithCredential are transformed into a VerifyAssertionRequest, so it
// makes sense to have this in the base class, but it can't be AuthCredential,
// because this method wouldn't make sense for email/phone auth, and I'd avoid
// OperationNotSupportedException. The solution is to have an intermediate
// abstract class in the hierarchy.
