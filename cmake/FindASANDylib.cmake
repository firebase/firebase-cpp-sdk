  # Sanitizers in Clang are supported by a specific runtime and Clang
  # automatically links against the right runtime. When building staticly
  # linked binaries, the resulting binary will contain the runtime. Dynamically
  # linked binaries will link against the dynamic version of the library.
  #
  # xctest bundles are necessarily dynamicly linked, but linked in such a way
  # that the sanitizer runtime is assumed to be on the @rpath. This finds the
  # clang runtimes so that they can be supplied as needed.
