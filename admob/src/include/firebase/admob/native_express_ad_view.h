/// @brief Loads and displays ads from AdMob Native Ads Express.
///
/// Each NativeExpressAdView object corresponds to a single AdMob Native Express
/// ad placement. There are methods to load an ad, move it, show it and hide it,
/// and retrieve the bounds of the ad onscreen.
///
/// NativeExpressAdView objects maintain a presentation state that indicates
/// whether or not they're currently onscreen, as well as a set of bounds
/// (stored in a @ref BoundingBox struct), but otherwise provide information
/// about their current state through Futures. Methods like @ref Initialize,
/// @ref LoadAd, and @ref Hide each have a corresponding @ref Future from which
/// the result of the last call can be determined. The two variants of
/// @ref MoveTo share a single result @ref Future, since they're essentially the
/// same action.
///
/// In addition, applications can create their own subclasses of
/// @ref NativeExpressAdView::Listener, pass an instance to the @ref SetListener
/// method, and receive callbacks whenever the presentation state or bounding
/// box of the ad changes.
///
/// For example, you could initialize, load, and show a native express ad view
/// while checking the result of the previous action at each step as follows:
///
/// @code
/// namespace admob = ::firebase::admob;
/// admob::NativeExpressAdView* ad_view = new admob::NativeExpressAdView();
/// ad_view->Initialize(ad_parent, "YOUR_AD_UNIT_ID", desired_ad_size)
/// @endcode
///
/// Then, later:
///
/// @code
/// if (ad_view->InitializeLastResult().Status() ==
///     ::firebase::kFutureStatusComplete &&
///     ad_view->InitializeLastResult().Error() ==
///     firebase::admob::kAdMobErrorNone) {
///   ad_view->LoadAd(your_ad_request);
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// @deprecated This class will be removed in a future version.
/// Native Express Ads has been discontinued, and are no longer served.
