/// @brief Loads and displays AdMob banner ads.
///
/// Each BannerView object corresponds to a single AdMob banner placement. There
/// are methods to load an ad, move it, show it and hide it, and retrieve the
/// bounds of the ad onscreen.
///
/// BannerView objects provide information about their current state through
/// Futures. Methods like @ref Initialize, @ref LoadAd, and @ref Hide each have
/// a corresponding @ref Future from which the result of the last call can be
/// determined. The two variants of @ref SetPosition share a single result
/// @ref Future, since they're essentially the same action.
///
/// For example, you could initialize, load, and show a banner view while
/// checking the result of the previous action at each step as follows:
///
/// @code
/// namespace admob = ::firebase::admob;
/// admob::BannerView* banner_view = new admob::BannerView();
/// banner_view->Initialize(ad_parent, "YOUR_AD_UNIT_ID", desired_ad_size)
/// @endcode
///
/// Then, later:
///
/// @code
/// if (banner_view->InitializeLastResult().status() ==
///     ::firebase::kFutureStatusComplete &&
///     banner_view->InitializeLastResult().error() ==
///     firebase::admob::kAdMobErrorNone) {
///   banner_view->LoadAd(your_ad_request);
/// }
