   * When the app is in the foreground all data payloads are sent to the method
   * `::firebase::messaging::Listener::OnMessage`. However, when the app is in the background, if a
   * message with both a data and notification payload is receieved the data payload is stored on
   * the notification Intent. NativeActivity does not provide native callbacks for onNewIntent, so
   * it cannot route the data payload that is stored in the Intent to the C++ function OnMessage. As
   * a workaround, we override onNewIntent so that it forwards the intent to the C++ library's
   * service which in turn forwards the data to the native C++ messaging library.
